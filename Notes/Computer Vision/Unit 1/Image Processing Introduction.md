## Image Processing
Image processing is a technique of performing operations on an image to enhance it or to extract meaningful information from it.

##### Key Objectives
- **Image Enhancement**
- **Image Restoration** (removing/minimising the distortions in an image
- **Analysis** - _extracting meaningful information from the images such as detecting objects, measuring the items, recognizing the patterns.
- **Compression of Images** - _reducing the size of image file to save storage space or to speed up the transmission over the network_
- **Segmentation** - _it is the process of dividing an image to analyse it_
##### Common Techniques and Methods
**1. Filtering**
- used in order to remove noise and *gaussian blur* from the image
- sharpens the blurred images
**2. Histogram Equalization**
- This is a method of enhancing contrast of an image by stretching out the intensity range.
**3. Morphological Operations**
- dilation of an image
- erosion
- opening and closing
	all this is done through the shape or structure within an image.
	**note: morphological operations are usually performed on binary images**
**4. Fourier Transform - _important_**
- transforming an image from spacial domain to the frequency domain to analyse manipulate the image frequency components.
**5. Color Space Conversion**
- Colour Model changing in context with application for easy processing and better analysis.
**6. Image Registration**
- aligning 2 or more images of the same source taken at different times from different viewpoints by different census.
**7. Feature Extraction**
- Identifying the key features from an image such as edges, corners, textures, shapes, etc.
